# Glossary

- **Heisenber principle**: 
$$\braket{\psi | M_1 M_2 |\psi } \neq \braket{\psi | M_1  |\psi } \braket{\psi | M_2 |\psi } $$
- **Strong Turing-Church Hypotesis**: all model of computation are plynomially equivalent. 

- **Exponential Time Hypothesis**: is believed that classical algorithm for NP problems can run in time $2^{\delta N}$ for a constant $0 < $\delta \leq 1$. 

- **Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis**: some believes that $\delta=1$.



<!-- - **PCP Theorem **: A language is in NP iif it has witness that can be verified probabilistically using only $O(\log n)$ bits of randomness and a constant number of queries to bits of the witness.  -->

- **Collinearity**:

- **Clifford group**: 

- **First order quantization**

- **Second order quantization**

<!-- - **[QMA - Quantum Merlin-Arthur]()**. Is a complexity class for decision problem. A language is in QMA if in polynomial time a verifier $V$ : -->
<!--  - $\forall x \in L$ there exists a quantum state over a polynomial number of qubits $\ket{\psi}$  -->
<!--  - $\forall x \notin L$ there exist a quantum state (the $\ket{\psi}$ plays the same role as the whitness in NP problems)  -->
<!--   Max-d-CUT problem is QMA complete. -->

<!-- Merlin is the prover: all-powerful and untrusted who gives the poor Arthur a solution (witness) to Merlin: a honest verifier with limited computational power. It plays the same role of NP for classical computers because if Merlin has to send a witness to Arthur of a NP complete problem, we know such witness will always exists, and that Arthur should be able to check in polynomial time that the witness is correct. {% cite jordanis2018merlin %} -->
