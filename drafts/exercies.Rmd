```{exercise, name="Distance between SPD matrices"}
Assume to have quantum access to the matrices. Write a quantum algorithm to estimate 
$$ d(\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2) = \| log(\Sigma_1^{1/2} \Sigma_2 \Sigma_1^{1/2} ) \|_F$$ 

(maybe a hint: recall that the frobenius norm of the matrix is the Schatten-2 norm of the matrix)
```

```{exercise, name="Hadamard after KP-trees"}
Cnsider the state after a quer to the KP-trees:
$$\sum_\ket{i}\ket{x_i}$$
what state you get after a Hadamard gate on the first register? What is the probability of measuring $p(0)$? What the state after measuring $\ket{0}$?
```



```{exercise}
Exercise on tomography of a pure state having quantum access to a state that is $\epsilon$ close to the new state. 
```


```{exercise}
Can you show that the definition of $\mu$ is a norm? Why? Why not? For which $p$?
