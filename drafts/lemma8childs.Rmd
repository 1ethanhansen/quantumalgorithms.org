TODO Write properly Lemma 8 form the paper "exponential improvements" of childs et al. 
This can become a nice exericse and can go directly in the introductory part, or near phase estimation
labels: good first issue

```{lemma, name = "Lemma 8 of exponential improvements of childs"}
Let $U=\sum_i^N \ket{i}\bra{i}\otimes Y^i$ where $Y$ is a unitary with gate complexity $G$. Let the gate complexity of $Y^{2^j} = 2^j G$
Then, the gate complexity of $U$ is $O(\sum_j^{\lceil \log N\rceil}G_J) = O(NG)$
```

```{proof}
Let $n = \lceil \log N \rceil$. Consider $Y^{2^J}$ for $j \in [n]$, with gate complexity $G_j \leq 2^j G$. 

The controlled version of $Y^{2^j}$ (which we call $c-Y^{2^j}$) is controlled by a single qubit, and has gate complexity $O(G_j)$ as well. 

The unitary $U$ can be implemented by a circuit that performs $n$ controlled operations, i.e. that performs $c-Y^{2^j}$ $\forall j \in [n]$. 

We now observe that the binary decomposition of the first register can be helpful for analyzing the complexity of this claim:
If the first register is in state $\ket{i}$, we have to perform $c-Y^i$. But we can rewrite $i$ as $i=i_n^2^n + i_{n-1}2^{n-1}+i_{n-2}2^{n-2} + \dots + i_12+ i_0$
The gate complexity of performing these operations, starting from the state
$\sum_i^n \ket{i}\ket{\psi_0}$ is
$$O\left( \sum_j^n G_j \right) = O\left( \sum_j^n 2^j G \right) = O(NG)$$
