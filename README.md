This is the repository for [QuantumAlgorithms.org](https://quantumalgorithms.org). 

This webiste is meant to be a set of lecture notes for students in quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning. 
It will be updated regularly with new research material. The scope is to bridge the gap between introductory material in quantum computing and research-grade papers, standardize notation, and be an overfiew on the state of useful algorithms for quantum machine learning and information processing.



## How to contribute

The book is written in bookdown, an R-based extension of markdown (even if you don't need to know R at all, it's simply markdown with some latex). 

The open issues are roughly organized as follows:

- minor issues (proofreading, checking steps, making sure things are clear enough)
- technical enhancements on the website
- major contributions (like new chapters)
- create and solve new exercise

Please refer to the file tipsandtricks.md for small but useful tips on Rmarkdown. 

In any case, if you want to contribute, [drop me a line](mailto://scinawa@luongo.pro)!


## Algorithms file

The book has some algorithms that are rendered as latex algorithms with a library 
for writing pseudocode. Successively these files are rendered as png via a python script. 
The text of the pseudocode of the algorithm is in the folder /algpseudocode/
When writing new algorithms, please use the template that you find there.
