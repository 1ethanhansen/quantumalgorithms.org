# Welcome to the repository for quantumalgorithms.org

This is the repository for [QuantumAlgorithms](https://quantumalgorithms.org). 

This webiste is meant to be a lecture notes for the students of quantum machine learning. 
It will be updated regularly with new research material. The scope is to bridge the gap between introductory material in quantum computing
and research-grade papers, standardize notation, and be an overfiew on the state of useful algorithms for quantum machine learning and information processing.

The book is written in bookdown, an R-based extension of markdown (even if you don't need to know R at all, it's simply markdown with some latex). 

## How to contribute

Please refer to the file tipsandtricks.md for small but useful tips on Rmarkdown. 
There are some open issues here, roughly organized as follows:

- minor issues (proofreading, checking steps, making sure things are clear enough)
- technical enhancements on the website
- major contributions (like new chapters)
- create and solve new exercise
- write snippets of PoC code

In any case, if you want to help, [drop me a line](mailto://scinawa@luongo.pro)!

## Algorithms file
The text of the pseudocode of the algorithm is in the folder /algpseudocode/
