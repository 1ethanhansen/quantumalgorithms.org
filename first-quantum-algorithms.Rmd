# Review of foundational quantum algorithms
In this chapter, we will explore some introductive quantum algorithms. Some of them, are not particularly related to data analysis or machine learning, but given their high pedagogic potential, in order to better understand the model of quantum computation we adopt, that we decided it was important to report them here. Others will prove to be really useful subroutines for the quantum machine learning practitioner.

<!--
# TODO Add notes and links on first quantum algorithms (Deutsch, and the likes)
# It seems that there are plenty of resources to understand quantum algos like
# Simon's, Grover, Deutsch, and so on, and this is not the scope of this website. 
# Nevertheless, some brief description of the result (preferably in the form of a theorem)
# can be a good exercise for a student.

## Phase estimation {#section:phaseestimation}

<!--
# TODO Improve QFT part with other non-Fourier transform (wavelet, fourier on groups..)
# It would be cool to have some non-trivial facts about the QFT 
# (like how to see it as a mapping between elements of a group to a Hilbert space).
# But also it would be even better to have more quantum transform, like the Wavelet transfrom.
# This can be really helpful in the context of group-theoretical machine learning.

```{theorem, phase-estimation, name="Phase estimation [@Kitaev1995QuantumProblem]"}
Let $U$ be a unitary operator, with eigenvectors $\ket{v_j}$ and eigenvalues $e^{\iota \theta_j}$ for $\theta_j \in [-\pi, \pi]$, i.e. we have $U\ket{v_j} = e^{\iota \theta_j}\ket{v_j}$ for $j \in [n]$. For a precision parameter $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a quantum algorithm that runs in time $O(T(U) log n/\varepsilon)$ and with probability $1 - 1/poly(n)$ maps a state $\ket{\phi_i} = \sum_{j \in [n]} \alpha_j\ket{v_j} $  to the state $\sum_{j \in [n]} \alpha_j \ket{v_j}\ket{\bar{\theta_j}}$ such that $\bar{\theta}_j \in \theta_j \pm \varepsilon$ for all $j \in [n]$.
```

While the standard implementation of phase estimation is based on the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) circuit [@NC02], there have been various improvements [@ahmadi2010quantum] which try to soften the dependence on the QFT circuit, while retaining the accuracy guarantees offered by the QFT in estimating the angles $\theta_j$.
\paragraph{Remark.} Note that the same algorithm described by theorem \@ref(thm:phase_estimation) can be made ``consistent'', as in the sense of [@ta2013inverting]. While in the original formulation of phase estimation two different runs might return different estimate for $\overline{\theta}_j$, with a consistent phase estimation this estimate is fixed, with high probability. It means that the error, between two different runs of phase estimation, is almost deterministic.



## Amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation
Amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation are two of the workhorses of quantum algorithms. In this section, we report both the original statement of the theorem, and a simpler version, which is better suited for the context of our algorithms.

```{theorem, thm-ampest-orig, name="Amplitude estimation, [@BHMT00]"}
Given a quantum algorithm $$A:\ket{0} \to \sqrt{p}\ket{y,1} + \sqrt{1-p}\ket{G,0}$$ where $\ket{G}$ is some garbage state, then for any positive integer $P$, the amplitude estimation algorithm outputs $\tilde{p}$ $(0 \le \tilde p \le 1)$ such that
	$$
	|\tilde{p}-p|\le 2\pi \frac{\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{P}+\left(\frac{\pi}{P}\right)^2
	$$
	with probability at least $8/\pi^2$. It uses exactly $P$ iterations of the algorithm $A$.
	If $p=0$ then $\tilde{p}=0$ with certainty, and if $p=1$ and $P$ is even, then $\tilde{p}=1$ with certainty.
```

In the original amplitude amplification algorithm, we assume to know $P$, i.e. the correct number of iterations. Later on, a fixed-point version of amplitude amplification has been proposed  \cite{grover2005fixed}, which has been optimized in \cite{yoder2014fixed}. These versions do not require to know $P$ in advance. Recently, various researches worked on improvements of amplitude estimation by getting rid of the part of the original algorithm that performed the phase estimation (i.e. the Quantum Fourier Transform \cite{NC02}) \cite{grinko2019iterative, aaronson2020quantum}. Perhaps a simpler formulation, which hides the complexity of the low-level implementation of the algorithm, and is thus more suitable to be used in quantum algorithms for machine learning is the following.

```{theorem, thm-ampest-orig-precise, name="Amplitude estimation"} 
There is a quantum algorithm called amplitude estimation which takes as input one copy of a quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, a unitary transformation $U$. 
```



```{lemma, amp-amp-est-simple, name="Amplitude amplification and estimation [@kerenidis2017quantumsquares]" } 
If there is unitary operator $U$ such that $U\ket{0}^{l}= \ket{\phi} = \sin(\theta) \ket{x, 0} + \cos(\theta) \ket{G, 0^\bot}$ then  $\sin^{2}(\theta)$ can be estimated to multiplicative error $\eta$ in time $O(\frac{T(U)}{\eta \sin(\theta)})$ and $\ket{x}$ can be generated in expected time $O(\frac{T(U)}{\sin (\theta)})$ where $T(U)$ is the time to implement $U$.
